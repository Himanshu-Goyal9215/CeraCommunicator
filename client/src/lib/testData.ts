export const sampleConversation = `Doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I'm Dr. Patel. What brings you in today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I've been feeling really tired lately, and I have this persistent cough that won't go away. It's been going on for about three weeks now.
Doctor: I see. Is the cough dry, or are you bringing up any mucus?
Patient: It's mostly dry, but sometimes I do cough up some yellowish mucus.
Doctor: Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
Patient: Yes, I've had mild fevers on and off, and I wake up sweating at night.
Doctor: Any shortness of breath or chest pain?
Patient: I do feel a little short of breath when walking up stairs, but I haven't had any real chest pain.
Doctor: Have you had any unintended weight loss?
Patient: Yes, I've lost about 7 pounds in the last month, but I haven't changed my diet.
Doctor: Do you smoke or have a history of smoking?
Patient: I used to smoke about a pack a day for 15 years, but I quit five years ago.
Doctor: Have you traveled recently or been around anyone who is sick?
Patient: No recent travel, but I work in a homeless shelter, so I'm around a lot of different people.
Doctor: Got it. I'd like to run some tests, including a chest X-ray and some blood work, to help us determine what might be causing your symptoms.`;
